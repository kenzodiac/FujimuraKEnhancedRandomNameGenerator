- "Enhanced Random Name Generator"
- This is a program where we built upon our previous random name generator. This time, we had to add additional functionality, including: randomly select one person from a saved data list; saving the list to local storage; the ability to add and delete entries at will; to display the entire list; and to break the list into groups depending on how many groups the user determines.
- I was able to finish all of the functionality of the list in time for submission except for displaying the sorted lists on the page. Those sorted lists will still appear in the console, however. I probably could have finished this if given an extra hour or so, and will finish it on my own time after class.
